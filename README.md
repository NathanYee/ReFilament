**The project**

We are taking a class at Olin College of Engineering called Principles of Engineering. For our final project, we decided to build a low-budget PLA recycler that will be used by Olin students who engage in 3D printing. Failed prints and extra material will be broken, melted, and extruded such that the resulting filament can be used again by a MakerBot.

This repository includes all of the code necessary for our recycler.
